//WAP to Calculate the product of all the elements in the given array.

//WAP to find the second largest element in the given Array in one pass. (one pass means using only 1 loop)

//WAP to find the minimum value out of all elements in the array.

//(Example: arr[5] = {2, 60, 11, 4, 42};
                  //output-> 2
//)

//WAP to find the largest three elements in the array.

//(Example: arr[5] = {2, 60, 11, 4, 42};
                  //output-> 60 42 11
//)

//WAP to check if the given array is sorted(in ascending order)or not.

//WAP to find the difference between the product of elements at even indices to the sum of elements at odd indices.

//Given an array of integers, change the value of all odd indexed elements to its second multiple and
//increment all even indexed values by 10.

//If an array arr contains n elements, then check if the given array is a palindrome or not. 

//(Example: int arr[5] = {1, 2, 3, 2, 1};
                   //output-> Palindrome

//int arr[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 1};
//output-> Not Palindrome
//)

//WAP to Merge two arrays nums1 and nums2 (both in descending order) into a single array sorted in decreasing order.

//WAP to find the smallest missing positive element in the sorted Array. (Take array as user input)

//(Example: //input-> 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7
                   //output-> 4

//input-> -5,-1,1, 2, 3, 4, 6
//output-> 5
//)


//WAP to find the first non-repeating element in the array.

//(Example: int arr[n] = {1, 1, 2, 56, 89, 56, 2, 31, 2, 89, 45, 34};
                   //output-> 31
//)

//WAP to find and display all the common elements of two arrays 'nums1' and 'nums2'. Print -1 if there are no common elements.
